## Setup

This does require a Azure SQL Database or Microsoft SQL Server instance to store data. There is usually a free tier for Azure SQL Database.<br/><br/>
<ins>**If you want to run this 100% locally**</ins>, skip the steps related to terraform and AWS CLI. Also, set up a **[Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Linux container with Docker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=cli&pivots=cs1-bash)** locally on your own as the database.

> [!CAUTION]
> Although there are free tiers for Azure SQL and AWS EC2 instances, <ins>please be aware that costs may incur with these services.</ins><br/> **I am not responsible for any costs that occur.**

### Prerequisites
- To run on local/development, install the following on your local machine:
  - **[Docker]**(https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- To deploy on AWS via Terraform, install the following on your local machine:
  - Install **[Terraform CLI]**(https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)  
  - Create an AWS account
  - Install and configure AWS CLI

### How to start Airflow locally
There is a powershell script setup.sh that contains scripted functions to bring containers up, down, and restart them (locally).

ðŸ‘† To bring up the environment, run the following command:
```
sh setup.sh start
```

ðŸ‘‡ To bring down the environment, run the following command:
```
sh setup.sh down
```
